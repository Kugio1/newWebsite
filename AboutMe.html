 <li> What is AI? </li>
</ul>

<p> AI, or Artificial Intelligence, refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.
The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem solving.
AI systems are powered by algorithms, using techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, and rules-based systems. I'm going to link a short YouTube video that 
digs deeper into what AI really is. </p>

<p> London Biggin Hill Airport generated £200 million to the UK economy in 2023 and has the potential to deliver more than £630 million in the future.
With indirect and induced supply chain effects considered, this translates to £142.9 million (72%) captured within the London Borough of Bromley, 
directly benefitting local residents, and £154 million within London. Biggin Hill was firmly established as a key experimental base for new technologies 
during the inter-war period such as sound location devices developed between 1919 and 1936 for the detection of approaching aircraft, hence the airport. </p>

<p> Bromley is undoubtedly London’s greenest borough, encompassing over 160 parks, 52 allotments and 21 outdoor sports facilities.
The Council is rightly proud of its custodianship of 7000 acres of green space on behalf of Bromley’s 300,000 residents. 
Much of the countryside around Charles Darwin’s former home at Downe is owned by Bromley Council and has unique cultural significance as the ‘open-air laboratory’ 
in which Darwin developed his theory of evolution by natural selection. Bromley council is home to many parks; one of the biggest parks in south London is in Bromley - 
Crystal Palace Park. Crystal Palace Park is a large park in south-east London, Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. 
It was laid out in the 1850s as a pleasure ground, centred around the re-location of The Crystal Palace - the largest glass building of the time - 
from central London to this area on the border of Kent and Surrey; the suburb that grew around the park is known by the same name.</p>
